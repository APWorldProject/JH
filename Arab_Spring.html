                        <p class="summary-text">Mohammed Bouazizi's death on January 4th, 2011 sparked 
                          uprisings throughout the Middle East, starting in Tunisia and spreading to Egypt, 
                          Yemen, Syria, and Bahrain. It only took 10 days after the death of Bouazizi for 
                          Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the president of Tunisia at the time, and his 23 year rule to 
                          end. He fled Tunisia, going to Saudi Arabia and became the first leader of an Arab 
                          nation. However, he was quickly pushed out by popular protests as the people of the Arab World 
                          revolted against authoritarianism, corruption, and poverty. On February 11th, with 
                          more than a million taking the streets of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak resigned 
                          after being president for 30 years. In Bahrain, marches ensued but were eventually 
                          suppressed by the monarchy. In Libya, western powers saw this as an opportunity to 
                          rid Muammar Ghadaffi, the Libyan leader, from power. It turned into a civil war and 
                          eventually, French, British and American air forces intervened against Gaddafi. On 
                          October 20, 2011, Ghadaffi was killed, marking the end of his dictatorship. In Syria, 
                          youth began speaking out against President Bashar al-Assad, but with violent repression 
                          from the government, the revolt turned into a civil war. In Yemen, on February 27, 2012, 
                          after many large protests across a year, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who had ruled Yemen for 33 
                          years, handed power to his deputy Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi. Although the Arab spring marks a turning 
                          point in world history through the many authoritarian rulers who were taken down by youth led movements, 
                          over a decade later, it is now debated if this truly helped Arabs. 
                          Today, in Egypt, the current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has led the country to little 
                          to no progress, and the economic condition is still in despair. In Yemen, the vast 
                          majority of people, over 75%, say they regret the Arab Spring. However, Yemen is still 
                          war stricken and many of the goals of their revolts are unfulfilled. In Syria, the 
                          conditions have only grown worse as 75% of Syrians regret their actions in the Arab Spring. 
                          The Syrian civil war has only gotten worse and, now, the Syrian crisis remains the 
                          largest displacement crisis in the world with 12 million Syrians forcibly displaced 
                          in the region. Although the Arab Spring may not have achieved what it set out to do, 
                          it shows that change can be made if the youth of a nation are fed up and decide to 
                          take action.
